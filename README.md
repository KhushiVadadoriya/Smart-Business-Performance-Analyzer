# Smart-Business-Performance-Analyzer
The Smart Business Performance Analyzer is a SaaS-based web application that ingests data from files, databases, and APIs, normalizes it, and generates text-based business insights. Only time-based and trend analysis is visualized using graphs, while other insights are presented in plain language. Data is stored internally using PostgreSQL.
